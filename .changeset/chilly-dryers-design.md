Vercel CLI now Collects Telemetry Data

The Vercel CLI collects telemetry data about general usage.

Telemetry allows Vercel to accurately gauge Vercel CLI feature usage, pain points, and customization across all customers. This data enables us to better tailor the Vercel CLI to our customersâ€™ needs, support its continued growth relevance, and optimal developer experience, as well as verify if improvements are enhancing the baseline performance of all applications.

Participation in this program is optional, and you may opt-out if you would prefer not to share any telemetry information with Vercel.
